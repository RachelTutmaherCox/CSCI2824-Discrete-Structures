### What's the deal with this workgroup? 

#### What this is:####
There are many diverse topics covered in the lecture section of Discrete Structures, CSCI 2824. A workgroup course provides an opportunity for students to get some extra "time in the saddle" tackling tough problems and taking a deeper dive into the course content than the shorter 50-minute lecture slots permit.

#### What this is *not*:####
This is **NOT** an opportunity to work on lecture section homework and ask the TAs questions about it. The TAs will **not** answer questions pertaining to homework problems during the workgroup, and will be on the look-out for instances of Academic Dishonesty (copy other students' solutions for homework). If you show up to the workgroup but do non-workgroup work, you are completely missing the point, and this constitutes an absence (more on this below).


### Course Web Page 

[https://piazza.com/colorado/fall2018/csci2830800](https://piazza.com/colorado/fall2018/csci2830800)

We will use Piazza for class discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the grader, and the instructor. **Rather than emailing us questions, we request that you to post your questions on Piazza**.  If your question is of a private nature, Piazza allows you to send us private messages to the instructors.  If you have a question specifically for Tony/Nihar/Tucker, please be sure to address your message to us by name. **It is your responsibility to check the web page on a regular basis**. 

Please restrict discussion on the Workgroup Piazza page to workgroup-related matters, and post general CSCI 2824-related questions or comments to the lecture section Piazza page.

### Coursework 

**Weekly worksheets**: That's it. Come to the workgroup, get in groups, work on some problems together on the whiteboard.

You do not need to turn anything in. You just need to show up and try. You should ask questions when your group gets stuck, but try to work through them together.


### Grade Determination 

This is a Pass/Fail course. Grading is based purely on attendance:
* You are permitted two (2) absences.
* If you have more than two absences, then you fail the class. Otherwise, you pass. Pretty easy, right?
* Being more than 15 minutes late constitutes an absence.
* Showing up and doing things besides the worksheet also constitutes an absence. **This includes working on lecture section homework.**
* Absences in excess of two will require documentation (e.g., note from a medical center). Documentation should be sent **electronically** to the instructional team via Piazza.

**Religious Observances**

Campus policy regarding religious observances requires that faculty make every effort to deal reasonably and fairly with all students who, because of religious obligations, have conflicts with scheduled exams, assignments or required attendance. If you have an exam or assignment conflict due to a religious observance please notify your instructor in a timely manner (at least one week prior to the due date).
